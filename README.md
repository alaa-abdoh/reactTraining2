# React.js Training App
Deploy Link: No link for this project because it is for training on JSON server, so the data is stored locally on my device.

Skills: React.js, JSX, CSS, JSON Server

In this project the focus is only on dealing with json-server, fetching data and React router, show the data from it, add data, edit data and remove data ( no focus on styling issues).
